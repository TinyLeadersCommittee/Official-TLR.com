  <h1>Format Overview</h1>

  <p>
    Tiny Leaders: Reborn (TLR) is a fan-created Magic: The Gathering 
    format designed for one-on-one play. It's a singleton format, 
    inspired by Commander, but with a unique compact structure that 
    emphasizes strategic deck-building, interactive gameplay, and 
    diverse strategies.
  </p>

  <h2>Key Rules</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
        <strong>1v1 Play:</strong> Intended for one-on-one games.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>3 Mana Value Restriction*:</strong> Every card must have 
        a mana value of 3 or less.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Commander Requirement:</strong> A legendary creature or planeswalker
        must be designated as a commander.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Deck Size:</strong> Exactly 50 cards, including commander(s).
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Sideboard:</strong> No more than 10 cards.
      </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Singleton Rule:</strong> Every card (except basic lands) 
      must have a different English name.
    </li>

  <aside>
    <p>
      <strong>*The Rule of 3:</strong> 
      TLR evaluates cards differently than standard Magic. For 
      multi-part cards (Adventures, Split Cards, MDFCs), 
      <em>every</em> face or spell on the card must independently 
      meet the MV 3 limit.

        color indicators.

      the sideboard.
    </li>

  <h2>The Philosophy of Tiny Leaders: Reborn</h2>
  <p>
    The Format and Play Experience of Tiny Leaders: Reborn is built upon several 
    key principles:
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Metagame Diversity</strong> <br>
    A healthy format supports a variety of viable decks and strategies, avoiding 
    excessive dominance by any single archetype.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Competitive Balance</strong> <br>
    While power levels will vary, the format should remain balanced enough that
    no strategy is overwhelmingly superior.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Counterplay & Interaction</strong> <br>
    Decks should have meaningful ways to interact with opponents, preventing 
    non-games where one player has little agency.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Format Identity</strong> <br>
    Tiny Leaders: Reborn retains its unique playstyle by adhering to its 
    structural rules, such as 3 MV or lower commanders and 50-card decks, while 
    evolving naturally over time.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Player Engagement & Enjoyment</strong> <br>
    The format should be fun, rewarding to play, and accessible to a broad 
    audience, from casual to competitive players, but leans competitively.
  </p>

  <p>
    Although Tiny Leaders: Reborn is a competitive 1v1 format, its 
    unique constraints offer plenty of different ways to enjoy the 
    game. The defining rules encourage players to construct decks with 
    cards that are "off the beaten path," leading to quirky 
    interactions where winning might not always be the sole purpose. 
    It truly does have something for every type of player.
