        <h3>Result</h3>
        <p>
          A card is said to have multiple sets of characteristics, if it 
          has more than one, of each of the following:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Name</li>
          <li>Mana Cost</li>
          <li>Type Line</li>
          <li>Rules Text</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In TL:R, every set of characteristics on a card must have a mana 
          value &le; 3. If a card has multiple sets of characteristics that 
          may be chosen for casting, each set must independently meet this 
          limit.
        </p>

        <h3>The Logic</h3>
        <p>
          From a design perspective, cards with more than one set of 
          characteristics are multiple cards sharing one piece of cardboard. 
          Every card must have a mana value &le; 3 as determined by each 
          distinct set of characteristics.

          <summary>How do I know if a meld card is legal?</summary>
          <p>
            We only look at the front face. The back is ignored when 
            considering Mana Value, Color Identity, or other restrictions.
          </p>
        </details>
  
        <details>
          <summary>How does Partner / Background work?</summary>
          <p>
            As long as both cards meet deckbuilding restrictions, you 
            can use them. If you play with more than one commander, you 
            start the game with a forced mulligan.
          </p>
        </details>
  
        <details>
          <summary>Can I change my Commander between games/matches?</summary>
          <p>
            No. Your configuration is locked at the start of the event. 
            You can swap cards between your 49 and sideboard, but the 
            Commander(s) never change.
          </p>
        </details>
  
        <details>
          <summary>Can I use cards with X in the casting cost?</summary>
          <p>
            Yes. We look at the mana value with X=0. If the card has 
            MV 3 or less with X=0, it is legal.
          </p>
        </details>
  
        <details>
          <summary>Can I use Adventure cards?</summary>
          <p>
            <strong>Discrete Philosophy Check:</strong> Every part of the 
            card must be MV 3 or less. You must check the creature 
            AND the Adventure spell. If either part is MV 4+, the 
            entire card is illegal.
          </p>
        </details>
  
        <details>
          <summary>How do I determine Mana Value of MDFCs?</summary>
          <p>
            For Modal Double-Faced Cards, both sides must, independent 
            of the other, meet the MV 3 restriction and the color 
            identity of your Commander(s).
          </p>
        </details>
  
        <details>
          <summary>How many colors can I play?</summary>
          <p>
            There is no limit aside from your Commander's identity. 
            If you find a legal 5-color Commander, you can play 5 colors.
          </p>
        </details>
  
        <details>
          <summary>Can I use a Companion?</summary>
          <p>
            Yes. Your companion and your deck/commander(s) must 
            all meet the Companion's restrictions and the TSMCR.
          </p>
        </details>
  
        <details>
          <summary>Can I use Split Cards (Fuse / Aftermath)?</summary>
          <p>
            <strong>Discrete Philosophy Check:</strong> Every part 
            must be MV 3 or less. Furthermore, per WotC rules, the 
            total MV of the card is the sum of its halves. Fire // Ice 
            is MV 4 and therefore illegal.
          </p>
        </details>
  
        <details>
          <summary>How do I determine Color Identity?</summary>
          <p>
            Identity includes all colors in the Mana Cost, Rules Text, 
            and Color Indicators. For double-faced cards, always 
            check the back side (except for Meld cards).
          </p>
        </details>
  
        <details>
          <summary>How do I know if I can use a flip card?</summary>
          <p>
            We only look at the "default" (unflipped) characteristics. 
            The flipped state is ignored for legality.
          </p>
        </details>
  
        <details>
          <summary>Does having multiple Commanders affect my hand?</summary>
          <p>
            Yes. If you have more than one, you take a forced mulligan 
            at the start of the game.
          </p>
        </details>
  
        <details>
          <summary>Can I use digital-only or Alchemy cards?</summary>
          <p>
            No. TLR is a paper format. All cards use their Oracle 
            text found on Gatherer.
          </p>
        </details>
  
        <details>
          <summary>How does the forced mulligan work?</summary>
          <p>
            Draw an opening seven, then put one on the bottom of your 
            library. This counts as your first mulligan.
          </p>
        </details>
  
        <details>
          <summary>Can I use Serum Powder on the forced mulligan?</summary>
          <p>
            No. Since the first mulligan is forced and involves no 
            choice, Serum Powder cannot replace it. It can apply 
            to future mulligans.
          </p>
        </details>
  
        <details>
          <summary>How does Urza's Bauble work?</summary>
          <p>
            Looking at a card is a one-sided reveal. Your hand remains 
            your hand. In a physical game, looking at a card with an 
            opponent is essentially looking at it together.
