      <h1>Tiny Leaders Reborn: A History</h1>
      <p>
        Tiny Leaders Reborn (TL:R) is a player-driven Magic: The Gathering 
        variant format that evolved from the original Tiny Leaders format (TL:O). 
        Developed by members of the French Magic community, TL:R emphasizes 
        active metagame monitoring, expanded deck-building options, and grassroots 
        organization through digital platforms. It is played using 50-card 
        singleton decks, led by a commander, with all cards having a mana value (MV) 
        of three or less.

      <section id="origins">
        <h2>Origins of Tiny Leaders (TL:O)</h2>
        <p>
            The original Tiny Leaders format was created in 2013 by Charlotte 
            Tackaberry, developed with Steven Hamonic, and later with their 
            friend and Level 2 Judge, Matthew Turnbull. The format, often
            described as a hybrid between Commander (EDH) and Legacy, gained
            early popularity in North America and was featured on platforms 
            such as 
            <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/feature/tiny-leaders-big-fun-2015-02-17">
              Magic: The Gathering’s official website
            </a>, TCGPlayer, and ChannelFireball.
        </p>
        <p>
            In Europe, particularly in France, the format spread quickly in cities 
            like Paris and Caen. Tournaments of 20+ players became common during the 
            years of 2016 & 2017, and Tiny Leaders was included in high-profile 
            events such as Demonic Tournament Commander, drawing over 50 players 
            each day during its debut weekend.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, by late 2017, concerns over format balance emerged due to the 
            dominance of a deck known as Mono-Blue High Tide. At a major event, 
            three identical Baral, Chief of Compliance (Mono-Blue High Tide) decks 
            made the Top 4 on both tournament days, prompting concerns that the 
            format had become stagnant. Although the TL:O committee later banned 
            High Tide and The Tabernacle at Pendrell Vale, the delay in response 
            contributed to a growing perception that the format was "solved" and 
            lacking support.

      <section id="founding">
        <h2>Founding of Tiny Leaders Reborn</h2>
        <p>
            In response, a group of French players founded Tiny Leaders Reborn 
            in early 2018, aiming to revitalize the format. The founding Tiny 
            Leaders: Reborn Committee included:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Olivier Manin (@OlivierDic&eacute;) from Paris</li>
            <li>Arnaud (@Plaguerat) from Caen</li>
            <li>Cl&eacute;ment Silli&egrave;re (@noskcaj1992) from Caen</li>
          </ul>
        <p>
            The TL:R team sought to refine and expand upon the original format’s 
            framework by introducing:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
              In  order to encourage more aggressive strategies a reduction in 
              starting life total from 25 to 20.
              </li>
            <li>
              To broaden deck design space, a change was made allowing commanders 
              with a color identity of four and five colors as long as their MV is 
              three or less.
            </li>
            <li>Frequent banlist updates, testing cycles, and metagame analysis.</li>
            <li>
              Modern rule alignments, such as updating the mulligan system to adopt 
              Wizards’ own mulligan system used for their official formats.
            </li>
            <li>
              Community-driven tools, including a Discord server with strategy-specific 
              channels and attempted a deck database support via 
              <a href="https://www.moxfield.com/">
                Moxfield
              </a>, which is still in the works.
            </li>
          </ul>
      </section>

      <section id="tlo-relationship">
        <h2>Relationship with TL:O</h2>
        <p>
            The TL:R team attempted to merge the two format branches by contacting 
            Steven Hamonic. Early conversations were positive, but talks ultimately 
            broke down over disagreements about color identity restrictions. TL:R's 
            openness to four-color and five-color commanders conflicted with TL:O’s 
            strict three-color cap.
        </p>
        <p>
            Rather than focusing on this divergence, TL:R shifted toward building a 
            self-sustaining infrastructure. While TL:O has remained inactive in 
            recent years, community members and leaders from TL:R prefer to respect 
            the legacy of the original project and emphasize that both efforts had 
            their place in the evolution of the format.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, in 2025, with the inclusion of Charlotte, the Original Creator of
            Tiny Leaders, into the Tiny Leaders Committee, a formal relationship between
            the two formats was established. TLO, including its rules and Blogspot 
            archive, would remain in stasis, preserving the history, origins, and 
            foundational work of Charlotte, Steven, and Matt. In this way, TLO 
            functions as a time capsule, documenting the beginnings of the format.
        </p>

      <section id="committee-evolution">
        <h2>Committee Structure & Evolution</h2>
        <p>
          TL:R is led by a Core Committee, initially composed of three founding 
          members. To increase feedback from the wider community, the format 
          introduced Committee Consultants. These individuals are active players 
          or community organizers who collect tournament data and advise the 
          Core Committee, particularly during banlist discussions. While their 
          input is essential, all final decisions are made by the Core.
        </p>
        <p>
          In its early development, the committee explored expanding the Core 
          to five members to avoid potential deadlock. However, shifts in 
          local player bases, the long-term effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, 
          and changes in community infrastructure led to a period of contraction 
          and restructuring. During this time, several founding members stepped 
          back from leadership or day-to-day involvement, prompting a gradual 
          transition in how the format was stewarded. This period ultimately 
          marked a handoff from its original local foundations toward a broader, 
          more distributed committee model.
        </p>
        <h2>Current State of The Committee</h2>
        <p>
          At the beginning of 2025, the Core Committee underwent another leadership 
          transition, Since then, the Tiny Leaders Reborn Committee has 
          expanded not only in size but also in structure.
        </p>
        <p>
          The committee now includes specialized roles such as Advisors and Local 
          Play Organizers and has grown to over a dozen active members. Each member 
          contributes to the development and promotion of the format through 
          responsibilities ranging from rules management, meta analysis, tournament 
          support, media production, and community outreach.
        </p>
        <p>

          Committee can find more information [here – page coming soon].
