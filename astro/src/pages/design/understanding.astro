        Tiny Leaders: Reborn is more than a collection of deck-building rules 
        or a curated banlist. At its core, TLR is the result of a deliberate 
        set of design philosophies working in concert to produce a distinct 
        Magic experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        To understand TLR is to understand the intent behind its structure. 
        Every element exists to support a clear vision of focused gameplay, 
        expressive deckbuilding, and meaningful decision-making under 
        constraint.

        <h2>The Core Design Philosophy: <span class="highlight">The Rule of 3</span></h2>
        <p>
          At the center of TLR lies its defining principle: the Rule of 3. 
          By restricting cards to a mana value of three or less, the format 
          establishes an environment where efficiency, interaction, and 
          identity intersect. This single constraint compresses the scale of 
          the game while preserving its depth, ensuring that every spell 
          carries weight and every decision has consequences.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Rule of 3 is not merely a mechanical restriction, it is the 
          foundation from which the rest of the format emerges. It governs 
          pacing, shapes power expectations, and sets the proportions that 
          define Tiny Leaders as an experience. Every other design choice 
          exists to reinforce and support this core principle.

      <h3>Supporting Design Philosophies</h3>
      <p class="section-intro">
        Flowing outward from the Rule of 3 are several supporting design 
        philosophies that give Tiny Leaders: Reborn its structure and texture. 
        These elements are ordered from the most familiar to the most divergent.

      <div class="pillars-grid">
        <article class="pillar-card">
          <h4>Commander Variant</h4>
          <p>
            TLR adopts the Commander framework: a commander in the command 
            zone, color identity restrictions, and singleton deck construction. 
            This anchors the format in familiar territory, providing each 
            deck with a clear identity and strategic throughline.
          </p>
        </article>
        
        <article class="pillar-card">
          <h4>1v1 Structure</h4>
          <p>
            Games are played one-on-one. This creates a focused environment 
            with clear objectives and immediate consequences. Unlike 
            multiplayer, there are no shifting alliances. Every decision 
            either advances your plan or disrupts your opponent’s.
          </p>
        </article>
        
        <article class="pillar-card">
          <h4>Deck Size (50 Cards)</h4>
          <p>
            TLR uses a 50-card deck, forming a compact “Tiny” configuration. 
            This size strikes a careful balance between variance and 
            consistency, allowing focused strategies to function reliably 
            without collapsing into redundancy.
          </p>
        </article>
        
        <article class="pillar-card">
          <h4>Sideboard (10 Cards)</h4>
          <p>
            A 10-card sideboard introduces a measured degree of adaptation. 
            Its limited size forces meaningful trade-offs, highlights 
            intentional weaknesses, and reflects an element of optimization 
            associated with competitive play.

      <div class="boundary-content">
        <h3>Boundary-Setting Design Philosophy: The Banlist</h3>
        <p>
          Complementing the core and supporting philosophies is the banlist, 
          which defines the boundaries of the format. These restrictions are 
          not arbitrary. Some establish the format’s power ceiling, others 
          protect pacing and play experience, and still others exclude cards 
          that fall outside what TLR is designed to support at all.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rather than reacting to individual decks or short-term trends, the 
          banlist reinforces what Tiny Leaders: Reborn is willing to be, 
          and, just as importantly, what it is not. It preserves the scale 
          established by the Rule of 3.

      <h3>A Cohesive Design</h3>
      <p>
        Taken together, these philosophies form a layered, intentional system. 
        The Rule of 3 defines proportion and identity. Supporting philosophies 
        provide structure and texture. The banlist safeguards boundaries and 
        expectations. None of these elements operate in isolation; each 
        reinforces the others.
