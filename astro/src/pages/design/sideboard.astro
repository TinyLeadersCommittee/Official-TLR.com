        Tiny Leaders Reborn decks include a 10-card sideboard, giving players a 
        compact but meaningful set of tools to adapt between games. The sideboard 
        is not designed to completely erase bad matchups or answer every possible 
        threat. Instead, it reinforces intentionality by asking players to decide 
        what their deck is prepared to fight, and where it is willing to remain 
        vulnerable.

        <h3>Focused Purpose</h3>
        <p>
          A sideboard exists to serve specific, focused purposes. With only ten 
          slots available, prioritization becomes unavoidable.
        </p>
        
        <ul class="purpose-list">
          <li>
            <strong>Strengthening Matchups:</strong> Bolstering your strategy 
            against specific archetypes.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Structural Support:</strong> Supplementing areas where the 
            main deck is naturally weak.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Targeted Interaction:</strong> Providing specific answers 
            against known strategies.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          That limitation is healthy for the format, preserving archetype 
          diversity and preventing decks from converging into universally 
          prepared toolkits.

        <h3>Optimization & Metagame</h3>
        <p>
          The presence of a sideboard also introduces a layer of optimization 
          familiar to competitive Magic. It rewards metagame awareness, forward 
          planning, and the ability to make real trade-offs over the course of 
          a match.
        </p>
        <p>
          While TLR is not exclusively a competitive environment, the sideboard 
          creates space for players who enjoy refining and adapting their decks 
          without making that mindset mandatory.
        </p>
        
        <div class="tension-box">
          <h4>The Tension of Choice</h4>
          <p>
            Every slot carries weight. Players must weigh flexible, broadly 
            useful cards against narrow but powerful answers that may only 
            matter in specific pairings. Those choices add depth not only to 
            deckbuilding, but to the act of sideboarding itself.
          </p>

      <div class="prose-block">
        <h3>Historical Context</h3>
        <p>
          Historically, the 10-card sideboard traces back to early EDH, where 
          sideboards existed as optional extensions of a deck rather than 
          dedicated wish targets. They were never intended to replace core 
          construction decisions, only to provide limited adaptability.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tiny Leaders Reborn carries that philosophy forward with enough room 
          to respond, but never enough to escape the consequences of your main 
          deck choices and shortcomings. By curating a 10-card sideboard, TLR 
          reinforces its balance between flexibility and commitment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Preparation matters. Adaptation is rewarded. And intentional 
          weaknesses remain part of the strategic landscape.
