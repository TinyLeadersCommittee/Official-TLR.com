        Tiny Leaders Reborn is, at its core, a Commander-variant format. 
        Decks are built around a commander, obey color identity, use the 
        command zone, and follow singleton construction. If you already speak 
        the language of Commander, the structure will feel immediately 
        recognizable, but every element has been refined for deliberate, 
        1-v-1 play.

        <h3>From Pastime to Purpose</h3>
        <p>
          Where the original Tiny Leaders emerged as a way to pass the time 
          between multiplayer pods, TLR is built with a clearer purpose. 
          Shaped by competitive 1v1 play in the French Magic community, 
          the format emphasizes tempo, sequencing, and meaningful interaction 
          from the opening turn onward.
        </p>
        <p>
          The smaller scale naturally rewards tight decision-making, and 
          while later design elements help support competitive strategies, 
          they are deliberately framed as options, rather than obligations.

      <div class="prose-block">
        <h3>A Spectrum of Expression</h3>
        <p>
          That flexibility is central to the format’s identity. TLR supports 
          the full spectrum of Commander expression, such as focused 
          strategies, offbeat themes, and experimental builds. You can 
          register a finely tuned list or sit down with a concept-driven 
          deck and expect the structure of the format to meet you where 
          you are. The format offers plenty of strategic depth but an 
          equal amount of creativity.

        <h3>The Gravitational Center</h3>
        <p>
          Your commander remains the gravitational center of the deck. It 
          defines your colors, informs your strategy, and gives your list 
          its identity, just as it does in traditional Commander. The 
          difference is immediacy and inevitability.

        <div class="callout-box" style="font-style: italic;">
          <p>
            With fewer cards and faster games, your commander matters sooner 
            and more often, as it anchors your plan from the very beginning. 
            Decisions come faster, stakes rise earlier, and the room for 
            clever lines and surprise interactions remains intact.

      <p>
        By preserving the Commander framework while refining it for 1v1 play, 
        Tiny Leaders Reborn strikes a careful balance of being familiar 
        without being derivative, while at the same time, competitive 
        without being restrictive. The result is a format that welcomes 
        Commander players through familiarity.

      <p>
        <strong>TLR offers a tighter, more intentional battlefield where 
        every mana and every turn matters.</strong>
