        Tiny Leaders Reborn uses a 50-card deck which is small by Commander 
        standards, but deliberately so. It’s exactly half the size of a 
        traditional 100-card Commander deck, preserving the format’s lineage 
        while fundamentally changing how games play out. The reduced deck size 
        creates a tighter, more focused experience.

        <h3>Deceptively Simple</h3>
        <p>
          The choice of 50 cards is deceptively simple, and that’s part of its 
          strength. In the original Tiny Leaders format, the number emerged 
          naturally as a clean division of Commander’s 100 cards. Other sizes 
          were considered, but 50 immediately established a stable identity 
          and never demanded revision.
        </p>
        <p>
          Forty cards, in particular, was intentionally avoided, as it echoes 
          Limited construction. At 50, the format occupies a distinct middle 
          ground that’s larger than Draft, smaller than 60-card Constructed, 
          and unmistakably rooted in Commander.

        <h3>The Middle Ground</h3>
        <p>
          From a gameplay perspective, that balance plays a key role linked to 
          deck design. Singleton construction introduces natural variance, but 
          a 50-card deck mitigates excessive randomness without sacrificing 
          personality.

              Decks come together more reliably and depend less on extreme 
              swings or singular haymakers.

              The singleton restriction preserves the variety and identity-driven 
              deckbuilding that players value.

          Your core game plan appears often enough to remain coherent, while 
          individual matches avoid feeling scripted or repetitive. Games feel 
          familiar without ever being identical.

        <h3>Earning Redundancy</h3>
        <p>
          This is where deckbuilding skill becomes most visible. With fewer 
          slots, redundancy must be earned through functional overlap, flexible 
          role-players, and synergistic design rather than raw duplication.
        </p>
        
        <div class="callout-box">
          <p>
            Especially in more competitive environments, TLR rewards careful 
            curation as much as in-game execution. Whether that means 
            methodically dismantling an opponent’s plan or decisively 
            advancing your own.
          </p>
        </div>

        <p>
          The 50-card deck is where TLR’s theme and mechanics converge. By 
          shrinking Commander without diluting its identity, the format 
          produces games that are faster, tighter, and more intentional. 
          It’s compact enough to support focused strategies, yet varied 
          enough to keep every match engaging.
