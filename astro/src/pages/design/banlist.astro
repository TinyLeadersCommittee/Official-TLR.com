        In TLR, not every ban serves the same role. Some define the boundaries 
        of what the format is allowed to be, while others are there to protect 
        the actual gameplay experience once you sit down at the table. 
        Recognizing that difference is important when we talk about specific 
        cards or look at future changes.

      <p class="design-note">
        At its core, this philosophy isn’t just about what you can do in TLR, 
        it’s about being upfront and clear about what this format isn't.

        <h3>A Heritage of Balance: The Lineage</h3>
        <p>
          The TLR banlist is the result of a decade-long evolution. It traces its 
          foundational DNA back to the most stable competitive format in Magic: 
          <strong>Legacy</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Instead of guessing what a healthy power level looks like, TLO, and by 
          extension TLR, started with a framework that was already proven to 
          work. From there, the list was adapted to fit a 50-card deck and the 
          unique feel of a Commander-style format.
        </p>

        <LineageComparison />

        <p class="design-note">
          This lineage establishes a shared starting point. By grounding our 
          earliest decisions in a system players already know and trust, we’ve 
          made sure TLR is built on clear, established expectations rather 
          than arbitrary guesses.
        </p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section class="chapter-section">
      <div class="prose-block">
        <h3>TLR Is Intentionally Below Vintage Power</h3>
        <p>
          Even though TLR pulls from across Magic’s history, it isn’t built to 
          support the kind of "win-now" efficiency you see in Vintage. This 
          format is designed with a much lower baseline for fast mana, massive 
          card draw, and easy resource conversion.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many cards that thrive in Vintage rely on things that just don’t have 
          a place in TLR, such as:
        </p>
        
        <ul class="standard-list">
          <li><strong>Games being decided in the first turn or two</strong> by explosive mana.</li>
          <li><strong>Extreme card advantage</strong> that costs zero or one mana.</li>
          <li><strong>A metagame defined by "free" spells</strong> and interaction.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>
          We’ve made a conscious choice to move away from those elements. Because 
          of this, some cards are incompatible with TLR by default. They aren’t 
          banned because of a specific combo or a single dominant deck, they’re 
          banned because their mere presence would push TLR toward a 
          Vintage-adjacent experience.
        </p>
        <p class="design-note">
          This decision underpins every ban that follows.

        <h3>Defining the Format’s Power Ceiling</h3>
        <p>
          Once the baseline is set, some bans exist simply to draw a line in 
          the sand. These aren't temporary fixes or responses to a specific 
          deck, they define exactly how powerful TLR is willing to be at its core.
        </p>
        <p>
          The cards in this category are so efficient that the rest of the 
          format would warp around them just to keep up. Including them would 
          change how everyone builds their decks, shrink the windows where you 
          can actually interact, and completely shift what players expect from 
          a typical game.
        </p>
        <h4 class="category-title">Vintage-Rate Power</h4>
        <BanlistGrid cards={vintageRatePowerBans} />
        <p class="footnote">
          Being on this list doesn't mean these cards are 'forever banned' with 
          no hope of return. However, bringing them back would require a massive 
          amount of testing and a format stable enough to handle them without 
          turning back into a 'Vintage-style' game.
        </p>
        <p class="design-note">
          Essentially, every other category on this page exists to protect and 
          preserve this power ceiling.

        <h3>Permanent Fast Mana</h3>
        <p>
          One of the fastest ways for a format to break its own power ceiling 
          is through permanent fast mana. Because TLR already plays so quickly 
          with its low mana costs, having access to early resource boosts has 
          a massive impact.
        </p>
        <p>
          It’s not just about enabling strong starts. Permanent fast mana can 
          turn a starting hand into a scripted win. It flattens the game by 
          letting one player skip the 'early game' entirely, which kills the 
          chance for meaningful interaction in those first few turns.
        </p>
        <BanlistGrid cards={fastManaBans} threeCol={true} />
        <p class="design-note">
          These bans aren't really about any single card, they’re about making 
          sure the power ceiling actually means something when you’re sitting 
          across the table from an opponent.

      <div class="prose-block">
        <h3>Tutors & Singleton Play</h3>
        <p>
          Playing with singletons is a core pillar of what makes TLR special. 
          Low-cost, 'no-strings-attached' tutors work directly against that goal. 
          They kill the variety we love by turning decks into predictable 
          toolboxes where the best answer is always just one mana away.
        </p>
        <BanlistGrid cards={tutorBans} />
        <p class="design-note">
          By limiting these effects, we keep a bit of healthy uncertainty in 
          the game. It preserves the unique identity of your deck and makes 
          sure that winning comes down to making the right choices with the 
          cards you actually draw.

        <h3>Bans Driven by Format Structure</h3>
        <p>
          Not every ban is about raw power. Some cards only become a problem 
          when you drop them into the specific way TLR is built, like our 
          smaller 50-card decks, the narrow range of mana costs, or the fact 
          that you always have access to a Commander.
        </p>
        <BanlistGrid cards={formatStructureBans} threeCol={true} />
        <p class="design-note">
          Within these constraints, certain effects get a massive 'unintended 
          boost.' They aren't necessarily broken on their own, but the format 
          itself amplifies them until they become way more disruptive than they 
          were ever meant to be.
        </p>
      </div>

    <section class="chapter-section alt-bg">
      <div class="prose-block">
        <h3>Designed for Multiplayer</h3>
        <p>
          Some cards are balanced for Commander games with four players, where 
          table politics and having three opponents act as a natural check on 
          runaway leads.
        </p>
        <BanlistGrid cards={multiPlayerDesignBans} />
        <p class="design-note">
          In 1v1 TLR, those safeguards vanish. Without other players to help 
          reset the scales, these cards often create 'lock-out' states where 
          an opponent is simply pushed out of the game.

    <section class="chapter-section">
      <div class="prose-block">
        <h3>Physical Dexterity & Logistics</h3>
        <p>
          We also set aside cards that rely more on physical dexterity (flipping 
          cards from a height) than strategic skill, or cards that create 
          difficult logistical burdens (like sub-games).
        </p>
        <BanlistGrid cards={logisticsBans} />
        <p class="design-note">
          By removing these 'logistical headaches,' we keep the focus on the 
          game and ensure that every player, regardless of physical ability, 
          can compete on a level playing field.

        <h3>Protecting the Play Experience</h3>
        <p>
          Even within a set power level, some cards just consistently get in the 
          way of a good game. We’ve found that certain effects lead to 
          repetitive patterns or 'non-games' that feel more oppressive than strategic.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because Tiny Leaders: Reborn uses smaller decks and is a fast-paced 1v1 
          format, these issues can take over as early as turn two or three, 
          leaving you with almost no room to adapt.
        </p>
        <BanlistGrid cards={playExperienceBans} />
        <p class="design-note">
          We view these specific bans as a final safety net, a way to catch those 
          'failure states' that still crop up even after our other rules are in 
          place.

        <h3>Categorical Exclusions</h3>
        <p>
          Not every exclusion is about a card being 'too good.' Sometimes, a 
          card just doesn't fit the scope of what we’re building here. These 
          aren't judgments on the cards themselves, but rather clear boundaries 
          that help define what TLR is.
        </p>
        <ul class="standard-list">
          <li><strong>Non-Standard Frames/Stamps:</strong> Silver-bordered, gold-bordered, and Acorn-stamped cards.</li>
          <li><strong>Conspiracy Cards:</strong> They bypass in-game decision-making.</li>
          <li><strong>Offensive Content:</strong> Cards with racially or culturally offensive presentation.</li>
          <li><strong>Ante Cards:</strong> Real-world stakes are not supported.</li>
          <li><strong>Stickers and Attractions:</strong> Added logistics burden.</li>
          <li><strong>Digital-Only Cards:</strong> TLR is a paper-only format.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="design-note">
          These rules are here to keep things consistent and accessible, making 
          sure the format stays true to its identity as a competitive, 
          paper-based game you can actually sit down and play.

        <h3>Banned as Tiny Leader (Commander)</h3>
        <p>
          The Command Zone changes everything. Having guaranteed access to a 
          card every single game adds a level of consistency you just don’t 
          get when you have to hope for a lucky draw.
        </p>
        <p>
          When certain cards are always available in the Command Zone, they 
          can lead to overwhelming leads or 'lock-outs' that skip the usual 
          risks of high-level play.
        </p>
        <BanlistGrid cards={commanderBans} threeCol={true} />
        <p class="design-note">
          Most of these cards are perfectly fine within your 49-card deck, where 
          variance and a little bit of luck still matter. But as a Tiny Leader, 
          they tend to warp every game around a single effect, which just isn't 
          what we’re aiming for with this format.

      <h3>Closing Thoughts</h3>
      <p>
        TLR’s banlist is intentional & responsive, but not reactionary. Some bans 
        define the ceiling. Others preserve play beneath it. Together, 
        they ensure the format remains deliberate, recognizable, and distinct.
