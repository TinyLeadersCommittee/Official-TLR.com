      <h3>The Harmony of Limitation</h3>
      <p>
        Throughout myth, philosophy, and history, the number three has held a place of deep symbolic 
        resonance. It marks the balance between creation, connection, and completion. From the divine 
        trinities of ancient faiths to the “rule of three” in storytelling, the number embodies harmony 
        through limitation. It is neither sprawling nor constrained, rather it is just enough to allow 
        expression without excess.
      </p>
      <p>
        In Tiny Leaders: Reborn, this principle isn’t just a rule, but an identity. The decision to 
        define our format around cards with a Mana Value of 3 or less wasn’t made by chance. It reflects 
        something intrinsic, not only to the flow of gameplay but to the very spirit of the game we love.

        <h2>I. The Sacred Threshold</h2>
        <p>
          When the creator of the original Tiny Leaders first tested the format, she and her team explored 
          various limits. The considerations for the mana value threshold of the format began with three, 
          but four was also explored. In the end, three just felt right. It wasn’t chosen by formula or 
          constraint, but by instinct.
        </p>
        <p>As she explained:</p>
      </div>

      <blockquote class="feature-quote">
        <p>
          “It was definitely influenced by cards that cared about cmc 3 or less. If I had to name a 
          specific card that inspired this the most, it’s definitely got to be Abrupt Decay. Smother, 
          Inquisition, Unearth — lots of black cards I liked and wanted to use. But I would say that 
          those just added on to the initial idea, which in itself was a lot simpler. . . just 
          brainstorming what mana value would be a good cap. Three is just a magic number, and when 
          I explored the options and found cards like those, it just solidified it the more I ideated.”
        </p>
        <cite>— Charlotte, Creator of Tiny Leaders</cite>
      </blockquote>

      <div class="prose-block">
        <p>
          That statement captures the essence of what makes the Rule of 3 so powerful. The idea wasn’t 
          forced, instead it revealed itself. The gameplay followed the same natural logic that myth, 
          mathematics, and even Magic’s own designers have discovered time and again. This discovery 
          being that three is the balance point where creativity and constraint harmonize.

        <h2>II. Divisions by Design</h2>
        <p>
          It’s no coincidence that Wizards of the Coast designs around this same threshold. Across 
          Magic’s history, three marks a natural dividing line, marking the point where efficiency, 
          interaction, and expression converge.
        </p>
        <p>Magic’s design language often speaks in mana-value “dialects”:</p>
      </div>

      <div class="dialects-grid">
        <div class="dialect-card tier-1">
          <h4>MV 3 or less</h4>
          <span class="dialect-meta">Precision & Interaction</span>
          <p>
            The realm of efficiency. Spells test skill and timing. Cards like <em>Mental Misstep</em>, 
            <em>Ocelot Pride</em>, & <em>Deathrite Shaman</em> reward tempo and resource imbalances.
          </p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="dialect-card tier-2">
          <h4>MV 4 or greater</h4>
          <span class="dialect-meta">Transformation</span>
          <p>
            The space of midgame pivots. <em>Collected Company</em>, <em>Supreme Verdict</em>, 
            <em>Chandra, Torch of Defiance</em>. They shift control and bend the arc of a match.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="dialect-card tier-3">
          <h4>MV 7 or greater</h4>
          <span class="dialect-meta">Inevitability</span>
          <p>
            The domain of myth. <em>Craterhoof Behemoth</em>, <em>Griselbrand</em>, or <em>Emrakul</em>. 
            Moments where the game transcends efficiency and resides in raw, overwhelming power.
          </p>

          Tiny Leaders chooses to live on the smallest of these stages. The stage where every spell is 
          deliberate, every choice carries weight, and creativity thrives under pressure. At MV 3, 
          decks can still express identity, but must do so through precision. It’s where Magic becomes 
          less about overpowering and more about outmaneuvering.

        <h2>III. Three as a Universal Constant</h2>
        <p>Across civilizations, the number three has symbolized wholeness within limitation.</p>
        <ul class="symbol-list">
          <li><strong>In Babylon:</strong> Heaven, Earth, and the Abyss formed the sacred triad of being.</li>
          <li><strong>In Egypt:</strong> The Sun’s cycle was divided into Khepri, Re, and Atum (birth, life, and rest).</li>
          <li><strong>In Christianity:</strong> The Father, Son, and Holy Spirit represent divine unity.</li>
          <li><strong>In Philosophy:</strong> Plato saw the simplest stable shape, the triangle, as the foundation of the universe.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The number three is not merely mathematical, rather it is archetypal. It speaks to the balance 
          between structure and freedom, which is the same balance we strive for within the format. 
          The Rule of 3 gives Tiny Leaders its soul. A soul small enough to be sharp, yet deep enough 
          to hold infinite creative possibility.

      <div class="prose-block">
        <h2>IV. From Debate to Definition</h2>
        <p>
          When Tiny Leaders: Reborn revisited its core design philosophy, the Committee found itself 
          divided between two schools of thought. These two schools, <strong>Team Bobblehead</strong> 
          (Discrete Philosophy) and <strong>Team Inquisition</strong> (Canonical Philosophy), each 
          reflected a different interpretation of what “3 or less” should mean.
        </p>
        <p>
          The beauty of the Canonical Philosophy lies in its simplicity. For deck construction purposes, 
          the format would allow cards whose mana value was 3 or less, as defined by Wizards of the Coast. 
          It offered a clean, familiar framework. Yet as Magic’s card templating evolved, that simplicity 
          began to blur. Modern designs sometimes feature two distinct “cards” within a single piece of 
          cardboard. Some of these costs rise above three, even when the card’s other face or half remains 
          three or less.
        </p>
        <p>
          This raised questions central to the spirit of Tiny Leaders: If part of a card exceeds the 
          boundary, can the card as a whole still belong in a format defined by it? And in allowing it, 
          do we drift too far from the format’s original intent?
        </p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section class="chapter-section">
      <div class="prose-block">
        <h2>V. Defining Identity</h2>
        <p>
          Ultimately, after months of deep discussion, and a formal vote, the format adopted the 
          <strong>Discrete Philosophy</strong>. The guiding idea is that, for deck construction purposes, 
          each face of a card should be independently castable by effects that reference “mana value 3 or less,” 
          such as <em>Perception Bobblehead</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          This decision wasn’t about legality alone. This decision was about identity. It formalized 
          the belief that what makes a card “Tiny” isn’t arbitrary, but rather about respecting the 
          boundaries that define the format’s creative space. From that principle emerged a need for 
          clarity. Thus, the concept of <strong>Cost Identity</strong> was born.
        </p>

        <div class="definition-box">
          <h4>Cost Identity</h4>
          <p>
            A deckbuilding analogue to color identity which translates the Discrete Philosophy into 
            a clear, enforceable standard.
          </p>
          <p>
            A card’s Cost Identity is the collection of mana values derived from every distinct 
            printed mana cost on that card, whether from alternate faces, halves, or other 
            characteristic-defining sets.
          </p>
          <div class="rule-highlight">
            A card is Tiny if, and only if, every value in its Cost Identity is ≤ 3.
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>
          This rule doesn’t restrict creativity, rather it channels it.
        </p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section class="chapter-section">
      <div class="prose-block">
        <h2>VI. The Living Symbol of the Format</h2>
        <p>
          In the same way that the number three symbolizes the connection of body, mind, and spirit, 
          Tiny Leaders: Reborn connects player, deck, and identity. The Rule of 3 becomes more than 
          a boundary. The Rule of 3 becomes a philosophy of design.
        </p>
        <p>
          When we play Tiny, we embody that balance. We express creativity through constraint. 
          We find depth in simplicity. Like the ancient symbol of the triangle, the format stands 
          on three points of strength: <strong>Identity, Interaction, and Imagination.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          The Rule of 3 isn’t about restriction, rather it’s about resonance. It’s the pulse that 
          makes this format unique.

      <h3>A Matter of Proportion</h3>
      <p>
        Every format in Magic has a philosophy. Legacy and Vintage embrace the full sweep of the 
        game’s history. Pauper champions economic accessibility. Old School emphasizes nostalgia 
        and simplicity, while Pre-Modern highlights a curated past.
      </p>
      <p>
        For Tiny Leaders: Reborn, it’s not power that defines us, instead it’s proportion. The Rule 
        of 3 aligns with something far older and deeper than a metagame or a mechanic. It echoes 
        the balance found in myth, art, and life itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        By embracing the energy of the number three, Tiny Leaders continues to stand as a celebration 
        of creativity through boundaries. By extension, <strong>Tiny Leaders: Reborn is a format which reminds 
        us that greatness doesn’t require grandness</strong>.
