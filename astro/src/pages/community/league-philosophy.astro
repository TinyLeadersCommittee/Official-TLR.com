      <h1>Official TLR Little League Philosophy</h1>

    <hr />

    <p>Hello!!!!</p>

    <p>
      Recently our discord community had a long discussion about how to improve 
      our little leagues. Lots of people had lots of opinions, which warmed my 
      tiny heart because it shows how invested our awesome players are in the 
      format and how they’d like to play it. We want you to know we really 
      appreciate that.
    </p>

    <p>
      We’re still working on how to best run the leagues and adjacent tournaments 
      and I imagine it’ll be an ever evolving project. So we want to ask for some 
      patience and grace as we do our best to manage the influx of new regular players.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, before we can do a lot of the work that needs to happen we need 
      to explain and define what we’re actually trying to do. So that’s what 
      this is! Explaining The Committee's philosophy on exactly what we’re 
      trying to accomplish with these monthly leagues.
    </p>

    <h3>The Philosophy Behind Our Monthly Leagues</h3>
    <p>
      The monthly leagues are there to offer everyone a place to play 
      <strong>organized</strong>, <strong>accessible</strong>, 
      <strong>low-stakes</strong> Tiny Leaders.
    </p>

    <h4>Organized</h4>
    <p>
      We want to provide a space where people know they’re going to get to play 
      at least one game this week. There is absolutely nothing stopping you from 
      playing Tiny whenever you want with anyone you want. Go use the LFG ping, 
      it’s great. But that has its limits! People are busy! Maybe you don’t have 
      an IRL playgroup you can get regular games in with.
    </p>
    <p>
      By joining the tournament you know you’re going to get to play Tiny this 
      week. We’ll find your opponent for you. We’re organized so you don’t have to be.
    </p>

    <h4>Accessible</h4>
    <p>
      When I say everyone, I mean absolutely everyone. That includes our new 
      players, veterans, spikes, casuals, people from the other side of the 
      planet from you, your dog, your friend from grade 3 who ate your lunchables. 
      Everyone.
    </p>
    <p>
      The monthly leagues will ALWAYS be completely and totally free to play. 
      Yes there are prizes available, but it will never be a barrier to entry.
    </p>

    <h4>Low Stakes</h4>
    <p>
      In short, we want the monthlies to be akin to your Friday Night Magic. 
      Your way to go test your mettle against other people for glory and fun, 
      and sometimes there might be prizes, but mostly it’s just because Magic 
      The Gathering is a fun game we like to play.
    </p>
    <p>
      In other words: <strong>It’s Just Not That Big Of A Deal.</strong>
    </p>

    <h3>Closing Thoughts</h3>
    <p>
      Because we want to keep the monthly leagues accessible (ie: Free) there 
      are limits to what we’ll do in them. But we want to reward our most 
      invested players by giving them the opportunity to convert consistent 
      success into something more than the monthly leagues can offer on their own.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our intent with the SCT season is to give players something to strive 
      towards during the regular monthly season. These invite-only tournaments 
      do have prizing. But again: this requires absolutely no buy-in from anyone. 
      The only barrier to entry is your own skill, and your commitment to playing.
    </p>
    <p>
      I hope this has adequately explained our intentions. If you have feedback 
      on how we can better achieve these stated goals, we’re always happy to 
      listen. Tiny is built on its community so we hope we can rely on each 
      other to make the best possible experience for everyone!
