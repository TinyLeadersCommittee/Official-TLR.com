    <p class="intro-text">Hello!!!!</p>

    <p>
      Recently our discord community had a long discussion about how to improve 
      our little leagues. Lots of people had lots of opinions, which warmed my 
      tiny heart because it shows how invested our awesome players are in the 
      format and how they’d like to play it. We want you to know we really 
      appreciate that.
    </p>

    <p>
      We’re still working on how to best run the leagues and adjacent tournaments 
      and I imagine it’ll be an ever evolving project. So we want to ask for some 
      patience and grace as we do our best to manage the influx of new regular players.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, before we can do a lot of the work that needs to happen we need 
      to explain and define what we’re actually trying to do. So that’s what 
      this is! Explaining The Committee's philosophy on exactly what we’re 
      trying to accomplish with these monthly leagues.

      <h3>The Philosophy Behind Our Monthly Leagues</h3>
    <p>
      The monthly leagues are there to offer everyone a place to play 
      <strong>organized</strong>, <strong>accessible</strong>, 
      <strong>low-stakes</strong> Tiny Leaders.
    </p>
    </div>
    
    <section class="pillar-section">
      <h4>Organized</h4>
      <p>
        We want to provide a space where people know they’re going to get to play 
        at least one game this week. 
      </p>
      <p>
        There is absolutely nothing stopping you from playing Tiny whenever you 
        want with anyone you want. Go use the LFG ping, it’s great. But that has 
        its limits! People are busy! Maybe you don’t have an IRL playgroup you can 
        get regular games in with. It takes time and effort to find an opponent, 
        and unless you’re the most organized person alive, you’re probably not 
        going to schedule a bo3 for the 2 hour window when you’re available in 3 days.
      </p>
      <p>
        By joining the tournament you know you’re going to get to play Tiny this 
        week. We’ll find your opponent for you. We’re organized so you don’t have to be.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="pillar-section">
      <h4>Accessible</h4>
      <p>
        When I say everyone, I mean absolutely everyone. That includes our new 
        players, veterans, spikes, casuals, people from the other side of the 
        planet from you, your dog, your friend from grade 3 who ate your lunchables. 
        Everyone.
      </p>
      <p>
        The monthly leagues will ALWAYS be completely and totally free to play. 
        Yes there are prizes available, but it will never be a barrier to entry.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tiny is for everyone and we really do get everyone here. We have players 
        from nearly every continent and so many different walks to life.
      </p>
      <p>
        We also understand that playing a niche commander variant micro-format is 
        probably not super high on most people’s priorities. Nor should it be. 
        Playing just one game per week makes the tournament accessible to people 
        with busy schedules, people from different parts of the world, people who 
        maybe just want to play a little bit of Tiny. We also start rounds at the 
        beginning of the week to give most people the most amount of heads up that 
        they may need to block out 40 minutes of their weekend to play. Plus 4 
        rounds fits nicely into a month-long schedule (for the most part).
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="pillar-section">
      <h4>Low Stakes</h4>
      <p>
        In short, we want the monthlies to be akin to your Friday Night Magic. 
        Your way to go test your mettle against other people for glory and fun, 
        and sometimes there might be prizes, but mostly it’s just because Magic 
        The Gathering is a fun game we like to play.
      </p>
      <p>
        In other words: <strong>It’s Just Not That Big Of A Deal.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        However, just like your regular FNMs, we can acknowledge there’s different 
        types of people playing. People have fun in different ways. We all know 
        about Timmys, Johnnys, and Spikes. These players can all coexist. The 
        important thing is we’re not going to separate these crowds. Your FNM 
        doesn’t divide out the casual from the competitive and we’re not going 
        to either.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is also why low-stakes is not NO-stakes. We keep things 
        <a href="https://blogs.magicjudges.org/rules/mtr1-12/">Regular REL.</a> 
        Because the rules do matter, and there are some things at stake
      </p>
      <p>
        Some, but not all, of our players are playing for real life money, and 
        there’s opportunities most months to qualify into more competitively 
        focused tournaments with more prizes. This is why we maintain our 
        cockatrice hash-code bookkeeping, this is why Gray gets paid the big bucks 
        being our resident judge (we actually don’t pay him but feel free to slip 
        him a 20)
      </p>

    <h3>Closing Thoughts</h3>
    <p>
      Because we want to keep the monthly leagues accessible (ie: Free) there 
      are limits to what we’ll do in them. But we want to reward our most 
      invested players by giving them the opportunity to convert consistent 
      success into something more than the monthly leagues can offer on their own.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our intent with the SCT season is to give players something to strive 
      towards during the regular monthly season. These invite-only tournaments 
      do have prizing. But again: this requires absolutely no buy-in from anyone. 
      The only barrier to entry is your own skill, and your commitment to playing. 
      If you only enter one league, you’re probably not gonna qualify. If you’re 
      scrubbing out, you’re probably not going to qualify. The SCT and Tiny 
      Titans tournaments aim to give those spikier players a higher-stakes place 
      to play. But everyone has an equal opportunity to earn invites so if you 
      want to play with the big dogs you gotta earn it!
    </p>
    <p>
      I hope this has adequately explained our intentions. If you have feedback 
      on how we can better achieve these stated goals, we’re always happy to 
      listen. Tiny is built on its community so we hope we can rely on each 
      other to make the best possible experience for everyone!
