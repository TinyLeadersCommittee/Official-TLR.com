        <h3>Result</h3>
        <p>
          A card is said to have multiple sets of characteristics, if it 
          has more than one, of each of the following:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Name</li>
          <li>Mana Cost</li>
          <li>Type Line</li>
          <li>Rules Text</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In TL:R, every set of characteristics on a card must have a mana 
          value &le; 3. If a card has multiple sets of characteristics that 
          may be chosen for casting, each set must independently meet this 
          limit.
        </p>
      </section>

        <h3>The Logic</h3>
        <p>
          From a design perspective, cards with more than one set of 
          characteristics are multiple cards sharing one piece of cardboard. 
          Every card must have a mana value &le; 3 as determined by each 
          distinct set of characteristics.

            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>
                We only look at the front face. The back is ignored when 
                considering Mana Value, Color Identity, or other restrictions.

            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>
                As long as both cards meet deckbuilding restrictions, you 
                can use them. If you play with more than one commander, you 
                start the game with a forced mulligan.

            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>
                No. Your configuration is locked at the start of the event. 
                You can swap cards between your 49 and sideboard, but the 
                Commander(s) never change.

            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>
                Yes. We look at the mana value with X=0. If the card has 
                MV 3 or less with X=0, it is legal.
              </p>

            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>
                <strong>Discrete Philosophy Check:</strong> Every part of the 
                card must be MV 3 or less. You must check the creature 
                AND the Adventure spell. If either part is MV 4+, the 
                entire card is illegal.

            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>
                <strong>Discrete Philosophy Check:</strong> For Modal Double-Faced 
                Cards, both sides must, independent of the other, meet the MV 3 
                restriction and the color identity of your Commander(s).

            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>
                There is no limit aside from your Commander's identity. 
                If you find a legal 5-color Commander, you can play 5 colors.

            <summary>Can I use a Companion?</summary>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>
                Yes. Your companion and your deck/commander(s) must 
                all meet the Companion's restrictions and the TSMCR.

            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>
                <strong>Discrete Philosophy Check:</strong> Split cards are 
                evaluated by checking each half independently. All halves 
                must have a mana value of 3 or less for the card to be legal.

            <summary>How do I determine Color Identity?</summary>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>
                Identity includes all colors in the Mana Cost, Rules Text, 
                and Color Indicators. For double-faced cards, always 
                check the back side (except for Meld cards).

            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>
                We only look at the "default" (unflipped) characteristics. 
                The flipped state is ignored for legality.

            <summary>Does having multiple Commanders affect my hand?</summary>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>
                Yes. If you have more than one, you take a forced mulligan 
                at the start of the game.

            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>
                No. TLR is a paper format. All cards use their Oracle 
                text found on Gatherer.

            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>
                Draw an opening seven, then put one on the bottom of your 
                library. This counts as your first mulligan.

            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>
                No. Since the first mulligan is forced and involves no 
                choice, Serum Powder cannot replace it. It can apply 
                to future mulligans.

              <p>
                Looking at a card is a one-sided reveal. Your hand remains 
                your hand. In a physical game, looking at a card with an 
                opponent is essentially looking at it together.
