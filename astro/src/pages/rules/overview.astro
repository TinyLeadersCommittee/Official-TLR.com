      <h1>Format Overview</h1>
      <p class="lead">
        Tiny Leaders: Reborn (TLR) is a fan-created Magic: The Gathering 
        format designed for one-on-one play. It's a singleton format, 
        inspired by Commander, but with a unique compact structure that 
        emphasizes strategic deck-building, interactive gameplay, and 
        diverse strategies.

        <li>
            <strong>1v1 Play:</strong> Intended for one-on-one games.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>3 Mana Value Restriction*:</strong> Every card must have 
            a mana value of 3 or less.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Commander Requirement:</strong> A legendary creature or planeswalker
            must be designated as a commander.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Deck Size:</strong> Exactly 50 cards, including commander(s).
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Sideboard:</strong> No more than 10 cards.
          </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Singleton Rule:</strong> Every card (except basic lands) 
          must have a different English name.
        </li>
        <li>

          20 life.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <aside class="rule-callout">
        <h3>*The Rule of 3</h3>
        <p>
          TLR evaluates cards differently than standard Magic. For 
          multi-part cards (Adventures, Split Cards, MDFCs), 
          <em>every</em> face or spell on the card must independently 
          meet the MV 3 limit.

      <h2>Additional Rules</h2>
      <ul class="rules-list">
        <li>
            <strong>Color Identity:</strong> All cards in your deck must 
            fit within the color identity of your commander(s). Identity 
            includes mana symbols in the cost and rules text, plus any 
            color indicators.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Commander Tax:</strong> {2} for each previous time cast 
          from the command zone.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Commander Movement:</strong> May move to command zone 
          from graveyard or exile as a state-based action.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Forced Mulligan:</strong> With multiple commanders, 
          draw 7 and put one on the bottom. Counts as the first mulligan.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Wish Effects:</strong> May only choose cards from 
          the sideboard.
        </li>

      <h2>The Philosophy of Tiny Leaders: Reborn</h2>
      <p>
        The Format and Play Experience is built upon several key principles:
      </p>

      <dl class="philosophy-grid">
        <div class="philo-item">
            <dt>Metagame Diversity</dt>
            <dd>
                A healthy format supports a variety of viable decks and strategies, avoiding 
                excessive dominance by any single archetype.
            </dd>
        </div>

        <div class="philo-item">
            <dt>Competitive Balance</dt>
            <dd>
                While power levels will vary, the format should remain balanced enough that
                no strategy is overwhelmingly superior.
            </dd>
        </div>

        <div class="philo-item">
            <dt>Counterplay & Interaction</dt>
            <dd>
                Decks should have meaningful ways to interact with opponents, preventing 
                non-games where one player has little agency.
            </dd>
        </div>

        <div class="philo-item">
            <dt>Format Identity</dt>
            <dd>
                Tiny Leaders: Reborn retains its unique playstyle by adhering to its 
                structural rules, such as 3 MV or lower commanders and 50-card decks, while 
                evolving naturally over time.
            </dd>
        </div>

        <div class="philo-item">
            <dt>Player Engagement & Enjoyment</dt>
            <dd>
                The format should be fun, rewarding to play, and accessible to a broad 
                audience, from casual to competitive players, but leans competitively.
            </dd>
        </div>
      </dl>

      <p>
        Although Tiny Leaders: Reborn is a competitive 1v1 format, its 
        unique constraints offer plenty of different ways to enjoy the 
        game. The defining rules encourage players to construct decks with 
        cards that are "off the beaten path," leading to quirky 
        interactions where winning might not always be the sole purpose. 
        It truly does have something for every type of player.
