        I've been playing since 1997. An old player I guess. I learn to play 
        MTG with these old rule books, you know these little non-friendly 
        things you found at this time in Starter decks. My story with this hobby 
        is long, so I won't give it whole, the main thing to note is: I never 
        give up (yes even when WotC created the Planeswalkers... what a shame 
        for the game, We are and remains the real PW!) After decades and various 
        ways to play and enjoy MTG, nowadays I play Cube and TLR, with few 
        competitive events (mostly in limited).`,
        petDeck: `Prosperous Bloom a long time ago, probably Kroxa in tournaments, 
        and Wilson (+ any color) for casual games`,
        faveCard: `Anje's Ravager – This card is absurd. I don't think I've ever 
        lost a game where I solved an attack with it.`
