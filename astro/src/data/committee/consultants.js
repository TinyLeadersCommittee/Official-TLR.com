        the Eldritch Moon prerelease, back when you'd go to FNM, grab a bite, 
        then right back to the shop for midnight release. I opened Emrakul as my 
        promo and she's been with me ever since (currently in my Pioneer cube). I 
        became a Judge because I love this game, the people it brings together, 
        the communities it fosters, and the opportunities it offers.`,

        Singleton gameplay is unbeatable in my opinion, since every game is 
        different. In Europe, we even have our own Highlander variant (100-card 
        singleton deck) that remains popular (Rakdos Goblins baby!). I also 
        play Legacy (Red Stompy), Pioneer (Gruul Control), and have a Pauper 
        and Commander deck, though I haven’t touched those in months or years. 
        I used to run six Cubes simultaneously; now only the good cards random 
        foil cube remains and is played from time to time.`,
