**Tiny Leaders: Reborn Supplement to the Magic Comprehensive Rules (TSMCR)**

This document is an unofficial supplement to the Magic: the Gathering Comprehensive Rules (MCR).

* **Last updated:** October 10, 2025
* **Effective Date:** October 10, 2025

Tiny Leaders: Reborn (hereafter referred to as TL:R) is an unofficial format not supported or endorsed by Wizards of the Coast ®. As such, all updates and changes to, as well as concerns with, this document are the responsibility of the TL:R Committee, which can be found on Discord here.

TL:R is intended, and this document written, for 1v1 play with physical (or equivalent) game pieces. This document may not apply to situations in multi-player games. In other words, while many games are played on digital platforms, this is a paper-centric format and digital-only cards don’t fit the framework of traditional Magic rules and policies.

In as much as is possible, this document will reference relevant sections of the Magic Comprehensive Rules, as well as follow the numbering format. As a Supplement, this document will only reflect rules that differ from the MCR (such as exceptions, changes, and/or additions). **Bold portions indicate content differing from the MCR.**
