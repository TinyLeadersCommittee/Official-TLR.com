## 6. Constructed Tournament Rules

**6.1 Deck Construction Restrictions**

Constructed decks… fifteen cards. **Decks constructed for the TL:R format must be exactly 50 cards, to include its commander(s). A player's commander(s) are determined as a match begins and cannot be changed during a match. If a player chooses to use a sideboard, it cannot contain more than ten cards.**

**6.8 TL:R deck construction**

**TL:R decks may consist of cards from all Magic card sets. Cards from expansions and special sets (like From the Vault, Magic: The Gathering—Commander, Duel Decks, Conspiracy, etc.) are legal in the TL:R format on the date of release of the expansion or special set.**

**TL:R uses two ban lists. One list refers to cards banned entirely in the format. The other refers to cards that cannot be played as a deck’s commander (banned as commander) but may be played in the main deck or sideboard.**
