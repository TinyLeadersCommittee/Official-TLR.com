Tiny Leaders: Reborn (hereafter referred to as TL:R) is an unofficial format not supported or endorsed by Wizards of the Coast ®. As such, all updates and changes to, as well as concerns with, this document are the responsibility of the TL:R Committee, which can be found on Discord here.

TL:R is intended, and this document written, for 1v1 play. This document may not apply to situations in multi-player games.

In as much as is possible, this document will reference relevant sections of the Magic Tournament Rules, as well as follow the numbering format. As a Supplement, this document will only reflect rules that differ from the MTR (such as exceptions, changes, and/or additions). **Bold portions indicate content differing from the MTR.**
